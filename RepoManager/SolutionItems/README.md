# Bulk Repository Manager

## Description

Blazor Web Assembly application to authenticate with GitHub, list your repositories, and allow you to select multiple repositories for deletion.

## Setup and Usage
To use this application, you will need to set up a Personal Access Token on GitHub.  Instructions on how to do this and then use it in the Repository Manager will be written when app development is nearing completion.


## Roadmap
* Use OAuth to authenticate against GitHub account
* Allow user to enter a Personal Access Token
* List all of the user's GitHub Repos
* Allow multi-selection of repos by using a checkbox
* Ask user for final confirmation before deleting repositories from GitHub.
